        A lightweight library for writing modular code
        
        ## Presentation
        
        `modular.py` is a small library that helps you write a modular and maintainable
        codebase.
        
        The library works with class: the loaded plug-ins are "injected" in
        the given class. You can specify the way of injection, either by stacking
        functions, with the `modulable` decorator, by overloading the base method, with
        the `overridable` decorator, and finally with the `alternative` decorator,
        which runs every function until it finds one that doesn't raise an exception.
        
        Those decorators conserve the original method's informations, such as name,
        module, docstring, and annotations.
